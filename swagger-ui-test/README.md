# Swagger-UI-Test

> Test of a multiversions API UI.

## Installation

Make sure you have _recent_ versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed.

```sh
yarn install
```

## Starting the UI

Run `yarn start` to start a simple Swagger UI.

The interesting files are under the `api` directory. What you are likely to modify is the `swagger-config.json` file which contains the different versions of the API.
